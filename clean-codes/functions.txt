*** Functions part of clean-code book ***


#- Rules
	a) They should be small (The function should be no bigger than screen-full. (24 lines, each line must at least have 150 characters))
	b) Do one thing 
	c) Stepdown rule (Reading code from top to bottom)
	d) Use descriptive names (Do not afraid to make a name long)
	e) No side effects (global variables)
	f) Do not repeat yourself

# Function Arguments
	a) The ideal number of arguments is zero (niladic), one is good (Monadic) and the max is two (dyadic) and the tragedy is 3. 
	b) The best for Monodic is an event (no output argument) 

# Output arguments
	a)  Output arguments are harder to understand than input arguments. 


# Important notes 
	a) Flag arguments (Boolean variable), passing it is truly ugly. (make two functions for each one)
	b) Where  a function need to have more than two arguments use an object as input 
	c) Prefer exception to return errors
	d) Put try and except blocks outside a function by the name
