*** Functions part of clean-code book ***


#- Rules
	a) They should be small (The function should be no bigger than screen-full. (24 line, each line must at least have 150 characters))
	b) Do one thing 
	c) Stepdown rule (Reading code from top to buttom)
	d) Use descriptive names (Do not afraid to make a name long)
	e) No side effects (global variables)
	f) Do not repate yourself

# Function Arguments
	a) The ideal nuber of argument is zero (niladic), one is good (Monadic) and the max is two (dyadic) and the trajedic is 3. 
	b) The best for Monodic is event (no output argument) 

# Output arguments
	a)  Output arguments are harder to undrestand tahn input arguments. 


# Important notes 
	a) Flag arguments (Boolean variable), passing it is truly uggly. (make two function for each one)
	b) Whera  a function need to have more than two arguemnt use an object as input 
	c) Prefer exception to returning errors
	d) Put try and except blocks outside a function by the name
